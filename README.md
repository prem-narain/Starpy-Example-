# Starpy-Examples

Contains Starpy examples which i wrote using  [StarPy Asterisk Protocols for Twisted](https://github.com/asterisk/starpy) for IVR Studio Dial Plan.

Brief Introduction from [Starpy Readme.md](https://github.com/asterisk/starpy/blob/master/README.rst)

StarPy is a Python + Twisted protocol that provides access to the Asterisk PBX's Manager Interface (AMI) and Fast Asterisk Gateway Interface (FastAGI). Together these allow you write both command-and-control interfaces (used, for example to generate new calls) and to customise user interactions from the dialplan. You can readily write applications that use the AMI and FastAGI protocol together with any of the already available Twisted protocols.
